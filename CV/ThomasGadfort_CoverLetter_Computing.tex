RE: Applications Physicist I, Job Code: 110006 \\
\\

\noindent
Dear Fermilab Computing Division Members,\\

I would like to apply for the Applications Physicist I position at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.\\

I am currently a Goldhaber Distinguished Fellow with Brookhaven National Laboratory, working on the~\dzero~and ATLAS~experiments. My research interests are in  searching for physics beyond the standard model, focusing primarily on signatures of extra dimensions and  of grand unified theories.\\

I obtained my Ph.D. in April, 2007 under the supervision of Gordon Watts at the University of Washington, Seattle where I wrote my thesis on the first evidence for electroweak top quark production using the~\dzero\ detector. I was then a postdoctoral research associate at Columbia University, where I led a search for a massive electrically charged vector boson ($W'$) decaying to a $WZ$ boson pair.  Such particles appear in a myriad of new physics models such as left-right symmetric models.  During this time I convened the group at \dzero~charged with improving the experiments's $b$-jet identification through the application of neural networks;  $b$-tagging is used in many analyses such as the top-quark mass measurement and low-mass Higgs searches.\\

%\textcolor{red}{Need something about WHY you want to be an application scientist.}
I am certain that my experience in the field of high energy physics research at both the Tevatron and the LHC, from maintaining a large computing cluster for the \dzero~level 3 trigger to developing GRID-enabled analysis software for the ATLAS experiment will enable me to support and strengthen Fermilab's experimental program as an applications physicist. \\


% \textcolor{red}{makes me a strong candidate PERHAPS OVERKILL -- need to tone down?} for the position of applications physicist.\\

\noindent
Sincerely,


Thomas Gadfort
